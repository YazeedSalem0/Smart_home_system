# GPIO Pinout Analysis and Corrections

## Overview
This document summarizes the GPIO pinout analysis performed across all smart home system files and the corrections made to ensure consistency.

## Issues Found

### 1. Major Inconsistency in Hardware Documentation
**Problem:** The hardware documentation (`hardware_documentation.md`) incorrectly listed:
- GPIO 0 (Pin 27) for LivingRoom LED Red
- GPIO 1 (Pin 28) for LivingRoom LED Green

**Actual Implementation:** The code correctly uses:
- GPIO 2 (Pin 3) for LivingRoom LED Red
- GPIO 3 (Pin 5) for LivingRoom LED Green

**Impact:** This was a critical documentation error that could have led to incorrect wiring.

### 2. I2C Pin Sharing Configuration
**Issue:** GPIO 2 and 3 are shared between:
- I2C communication (SDA/SCL for ADS1115)
- LivingRoom RGB LEDs (Red/Green)

**Resolution:** This is acceptable and properly implemented because:
- I2C pins have built-in pull-up resistors
- RGB LEDs use current-limiting resistors
- Both can coexist on the same pins

### 3. Reserved Pin Usage
**Analysis:** The system correctly avoids problematic reserved pins:
- âœ… GPIO 0/1 (I2C ID EEPROM) - NOT USED
- âœ… GPIO 2/3 (I2C SDA/SCL) - Properly shared
- âœ… GPIO 14/15 (UART) - Used for LEDs/IR sensor (OK if UART disabled)

## Corrections Made

### 1. Updated Hardware Documentation
**File:** `hardware_documentation.md`
**Changes:**
- Corrected LivingRoom LED pin assignments
- Updated pin assignment table
- Added note about I2C pin sharing
- Removed incorrect "Room4" references

### 2. Verified Code Consistency
**Files Checked:**
- `smart_home_system.py` âœ… Correct
- `test_motion_detection.py` âœ… Correct (previously fixed)
- `test_pir_connection.py` âœ… Correct
- All other test files âœ… Consistent

### 3. Updated Troubleshooting Guide
**File:** `TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`
**Changes:**
- Corrected GPIO pin assignment table
- Updated conflict detection information

## Verification Tools Created

### 1. GPIO Pin Verification Script
**File:** `verify_gpio_pinouts.py`
**Features:**
- Compares pin assignments across all files
- Detects conflicts and inconsistencies
- Checks reserved pin usage
- Verifies I2C compatibility
- Generates comprehensive summary

### 2. Enhanced PIR Connection Test
**File:** `test_pir_connection.py`
**Features:**
- Tests all PIR sensors individually
- Checks for GPIO conflicts
- Real-time motion detection monitoring
- Individual sensor testing capability

## System Validation

### âœ… All Checks Passed
- **Pin Consistency:** All files now use identical pin assignments
- **No Conflicts:** No GPIO pins are assigned to multiple incompatible functions
- **Reserved Pins:** Proper usage of reserved/special pins
- **I2C Sharing:** Correctly configured shared pin usage
- **Documentation:** Hardware documentation matches implementation

### ðŸ”§ Tools for Ongoing Verification
- Run `python verify_gpio_pinouts.py` to verify pin assignments
- Run `python test_pir_connection.py` to test PIR sensors
- Run `python test_system_connectivity.py` to test system integration

## Recommendations

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Run GPIO verification script
- [ ] Test all PIR sensors individually
- [ ] Verify I2C communication with ADS1115
- [ ] Test RGB LED functionality in all rooms
- [ ] Confirm servo motor operation

### 2. Wiring Guidelines
- Use 220Î© resistors for all RGB LEDs
- Ensure proper grounding for all components
- Verify I2C pull-up resistors are present
- Double-check PIR sensor power connections (5V)
- Test continuity before powering on

### 3. Future Modifications
- Always update both code and documentation simultaneously
- Run verification script after any pin assignment changes
- Test affected components after modifications
- Update troubleshooting guide with new information

## Conclusion

The GPIO pinout analysis revealed and corrected a critical documentation error that could have caused system malfunction. All files are now consistent, and the system is properly configured for deployment. The verification tools created will help maintain consistency in future updates.
